VoicemailPasswordGuesser
========================

This project attempts to use AppleScript to control Skype in such a way that Skype dials a number and guesses a password until it gains entry to the voicemail box.

Motivation
----------
A relative passed away suddenly and his kin would like to listen to his voicemail. The kin do not know the password to the voidemail though.
